  <h1>Herbal Support for Your BMI Category</h1>
  <p>This guide offers Traditional Chinese Medicine herbal insight based on your BMI result. It aims to provide gentle, balanced support—not medical advice. Please consult a qualified practitioner before beginning any herbal regimen.</p>

  <section id="underweight">
    <h2>Underweight (BMI &lt; 18.5)</h2>
    <p>For those in the underweight range, TCM often sees <strong>Spleen Qi deficiency</strong> or weak digestion. Herbs that gently strengthen and nourish include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Codonopsis (Dang Shen)</strong>: Tonifies Qi and improves energy levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Hawthorn fruit (Shan Zha)</strong>: Promotes digestion and appetite, especially for fatty foods.</li>
      <li><strong>Licorice root (Gan Cao)</strong>: Harmonizes herbal formulas and supports Spleen health.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consider combining these in a mild tonic—Codonopsis, Hawthorn, and Licorice—often used in TCM to support appetite and digestion.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="healthy">
    <h2>Healthy Weight (BMI 18.5–24.9)</h2>
    <p>Maintaining this range often aligns with good Qi flow and balanced metabolism. Herbs that support vitality include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>American ginseng (Xi Yang Shen)</strong>: Nourishes Qi and supports stamina.</li>
      <li><strong>Green tea (Lu Cha)</strong>: Mild metabolic support and antioxidant benefits.</li>
      <li><strong>Jujube date (Da Zao)</strong>: Gently harmonizes and calms, helpful in dietary balance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are supportive herbs, ideal for daily use to promote overall wellness and energy balance.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="overweight">
    <h2>Overweight (BMI 25–29.9)</h2>
    <p>This range may indicate <strong>Dampness accumulation</strong> or reduced circulation within TCM principles. Herbs that help invigorate and regulate include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cinnamon twig (Gui Zhi)</strong>: Warms the channels and promotes movement.</li>
      <li><strong>Lotus leaf (He Ye)</strong>: Clears and transforms dampness.</li>
      <li><strong>Poria mushroom (Fu Ling)</strong>: Supports fluid balance and digestive function.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These herbs are often combined in teas designed to support dampness transformation and light circulation support.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="obesity1">
    <h2>Obesity Class I (BMI 30–34.9)</h2>
    <p>Higher BMI levels may correspond to internal heat, phlegm-dampness, or blood stasis in TCM. Supportive herbs include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Curcumin (Jiang Huang/Turmeric)</strong>: Anti-inflammatory and circulatory support.</li>
      <li><strong>Red peony root (Chi Shao)</strong>: Helps move stagnant blood.</li>
      <li><strong>Hawthorn leaf & flower (Shan Zha Ye)</strong>: Supports digestion and circulation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These herbs are often used in gentle circulatory and metabolic tonic formulas.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="obesity2">
    <h2>Obesity Class II–III (BMI ≥ 35)</h2>
    <p>This higher range may involve chronic inflammation, stagnant Qi, and metabolic stress. Consider these supportive herbs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Turmeric (Jiang Huang) with Black Pepper</strong>: Enhances absorption; supports inflammation pathways.</li>
      <li><strong>Green tea extract (Lu Cha concentrated)</strong>: Supports healthy metabolism.</li>
      <li><strong>Ginger (Sheng Jiang)</strong>: Promotes Qi movement and digestive harmony.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These herbs should ideally be part of a personalized herbal formula—especially at higher BMI levels, professional guidance is recommended.</p>
